## Warmup: Fibonacci
The Fibonacci Sequence, which sums each number with the one before it, is a great example of a problem that can be solved recursively.


# Project: merge sort
Sorting algorithms are a great way to get to grips with recursion. One such algorithm is Merge Sort, a type of sort that lends itself well to recursion and can be much faster than other algorithms such as bubble sort on the right data sets. You’ll build a function which sorts a given array but uses a “merge sort” function for doing so.

It can be a bit strange to wrap your head around, but just remember you’re “dividing and conquering” the problem.
